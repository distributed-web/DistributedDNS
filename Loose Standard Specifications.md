**DDNS â€“ Distributed Domain Name System
***Distributed DNS that support Dynamic IP Addresses
Aaron N Gray
By providing specialize local DNS servers Working as a localhost server provision of domain and subdomain mapping to dynamic IP address. This is addressed in addition to normal DNS lookup. A secure transport communication system via a dedicated distributed IP protocol provides updates and propagation of DNS updates. Additional secure DNS access is also possible with this model and will also provide robustness, resilience and, additional local caching in parallel to the conventional DNS system. This will allow DHCP local network subspace as well as SNMP network allocation of domains and or sub domains via DDNS. This is all totally transparent to normal DNS protocol access.
